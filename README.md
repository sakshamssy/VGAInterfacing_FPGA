# VGAInterfacing_FPGA
The objective is to make a video card that stores a low-bit (low resolution and
colour-accurate) image and a VGA interface to display on an LCD monitor.
As we know, VGAs are used in old displays as a medium to transmit data to
be displayed.
A stand-alone VGA interface cannot display anything; thus, a supporting
graphics card or video card is required to fetch and send the data in proper
order. This project could be extended to output a simple game on a screen
and can be played by user input from FPGA
